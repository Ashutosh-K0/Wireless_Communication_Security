# Secure Communication & Key Generation (MATLAB)

This MATLAB project simulates secure communication using relative calibration techniques (STLS & Circulant Deconvolution). It evaluates performance over varying SNR levels and generates shared binary and alphanumeric keys.

## Features
- Channel simulation with noise
- Signal calibration using STLS & Circulant methods
- Key generation from calibrated signals
- Plots for correlation, improvement, and execution time

## How to Run
1. Open `Full_Wireless.m` in MATLAB.
2. Run the script.
3. View keys and plots in the output.
